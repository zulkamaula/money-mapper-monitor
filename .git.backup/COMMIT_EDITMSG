security: Remove .env file with exposed Supabase credentials from repository

Security Fix:
- Deleted .env file containing Supabase URL and anon key
- Prevents accidental exposure of environment variables in version control
- .env already added to .gitignore in previous commit

Note: Users must create their own .env file following .env.example template
